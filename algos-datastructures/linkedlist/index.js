/* 
what is a linked list? 
Made up of a bunch of nodes that store data

different nodes connected by pointers

last node set to null

first node as head, last node as tail

ordered data structure, follow the "next" pointer

vs an array -
position vs index 
elements vs nodes 

elements in array stored right next to each other
good for searching, bad for insertion or deletion because you have to shift elements in existing array. what if the array was 1,000 elements, o(n) insertion time 

vs linked list 
for insertion, no insertion
change two pointers

traversing a linked list 
just pass a reference to the head node
current.next passes along each node
